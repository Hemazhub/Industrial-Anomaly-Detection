# Industrial-Anomaly-Detection
Developing an anomaly detection system for industrial equipment.
# Objective: 
Detect unusual behavior and prevent equipment failure. Building a classification model to detect anomalies involves several steps. Anomalies are instances that deviate from the norm, and a classification model can be trained to distinguish between normal and anomalous instances.
# Tasks Performed:
1. Data Generation/Preprocessing
2. Anomaly Detection Model
3. Model Evaluation
4. Visualization & Reporting
